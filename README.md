# OB_Studio_Crossover
The OB-Studio Crossover system is a communication tool that serves to connect a Broadcast Technician with a Radio Presenter who are located in different operational areas, with the goal of facilitating Transmission Crossovers between the Studio and Outside Broadcasting team. This system acts as a bridge to enable seamless communication between the parties involved, thereby streamlining the crossover process and reducing the time and effort required to coordinate the operation.

# Broadcast Crossover Request System
This is a Flask program project that enables Broadcast engineers in the Master Control Room (MCR) to request transmission crossover from the Studio to Outside Broadcasting. The program provides an easy-to-use interface that allows engineers to submit requests, track their status, and receive updates.

The program is designed to streamline the process of requesting transmission crossover, which can often involve multiple parties and require coordination between different departments. With this program, engineers can submit requests directly and receive updates in real-time, reducing the time and effort required to manage the crossover process.

The program is built using the Flask framework and is designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to deploy. It includes a user authentication system to ensure that only authorized engineers can access the system, as well as a comprehensive tracking system to monitor the status of requests.

This repository contains the source code for the program, as well as documentation and installation instructions. It is intended to be used by Broadcast engineers and technical staff who are responsible for managing transmission crossover requests in a broadcast facility.
